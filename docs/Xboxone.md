You wil notice that apps that emulat Xinput controllers can se and map the Xbox one controller but can not fake it as something else cause it is already xinput, to make the controller work with those apps and make windows see it as an xbox 360 controller follow this:

Go to Windows control panel, hardware and sound, devices and printers

You should see your connected controllers, right click on your xbox one gamepad, select properties, select hardware tag and the xinput controller and click on properties again, 

in the general tab select change configuration, next go to the drivers tab and select update driver, select "Browse my computer", "Let me pick from the list". you should be three options, the one you are already

Using and other two, select HID-compliant game controller. Once it finishes installing games will pick your xbox one controller as a Dinput gamepad, now you can use apps like xouput to make them see it as an xbox 360 controller fr better compatibility with some Nucleus handler and gaes that have issues with xbox one gmepads even without Nucleus.

If you want To revert the change just follow the same process and select the xinput drivers you were using between the 3 that show.

Open xoutput or x360ce now and map your xbox one gamepad and you are good to go.
